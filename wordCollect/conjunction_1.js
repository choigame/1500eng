All things considered ...<br>\
<br>\
- All things considered, a certain reserved position for women in high-level job is actually a good idea to empower the women towards the overall betterment of the organization and society.<br>\
- In general, it can be stated that in upcoming years, humans will be blessed with adequate facilities, which definitely will make their lives quite easier, due to the advanced technology.<br>\
- As a rule, in most countries, a zoological garden is monitored strictly, and the health, treatment, and the food are properly ensured for the animals they keep.<br>\

- If the proper measurements and initiatives are not taken, the pollution will keep on increasing, and that would someday threaten the existence of human’s life.<br>\
- Unless men change the diet and get involved in some sort of outdoor activities and sports, the average weight would keep increasing.<br>\
- For this reasons, employees should preserve a certain percentage of high level jobs for qualified women.<br>\

- Of course, learning from books in a formal educational institution, and learning from books for someone’s own interest is highly important.<br>\
- Practical lessons would definitely help students have a deeply understanding, while theory learned from books will be forgotten far easier.<br>\
- Undoubtedly, ultimate exhaust of natural resources would create chaos, and many wild lives would be endangered as well.<br>\
<br>\
Summary, conclusion:<br>\
<br>\
As can be seen<br>\
Generally speaking<br>\
In the final analysis<br>\
All things considered<br>\
As shown above<br>\
In the long run<br>\
Given these points<br>\

On the whole<br>\
In any event<br>\
In either case<br>\
All in all<br>\
Obviously<br>\
Ultimately<br>\
Definitely<br>\
In a word ...<br>\
To put it simply ...<br>\
That is to say ...<br>\
- In a word, the idea can be very useful for the developing countries but for the US, it might be a sinister.<br>\
- That is to say, parents must ensure the safety of their children first.<br>\
- In short, overall infrastructure of the area will develop.<br>\
- To sum up, parents are important teachers in people’s lives and none can deny their invaluable role, but they are not always the best teachers.<br>\
- On the whole, industrialization is necessary for growth, it must be regulated. The proper measures must be in place to reduce the negative impacts of byproducts on environment.<br>\
- In general, even though it is preferable to study English in an English-speaking country, a reasonable level of English can be achieved in one’s own country, if a student is gifted and dedicated to study.2) To sum up, if the population explosion continues, many more people will die of starvation in poor countries, and life in the cities, even in affluent nations, will become increasingly difficult.<br>\
- To conclude, I recommend that the only sensible way to solve this problem is to educate young people about the dangers of drug use, and to take steps to reduce the pressure of competition placed upon them.<br>\
- In conclusion, nuclear technology certainly has positive uses but is nonetheless dangerous.  However, it would have been better if it had never been used to create nuclear weapons. If life on Earth is to continue, all the nuclear nations of the world should agree to disarm as soon as possible."
