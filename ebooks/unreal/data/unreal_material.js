	,en:"One of the most common things to do with a Mask Texture is to use it to control the Emissive sections of a Material. This is usually done by first creating a Emissive Mask texture that uses White to define what sections of the Material should be Emissive and then multiplying that Mask texture by a color inside the Material Editor. This is generally done so that you have more control over the look and intensity of the Emissive effect. In the following example, we can see Emissive Texture Masking in action."

	,en:"In Unreal Engine, Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM) is an advanced technique that enhances the visual realism of surfaces by simulating the appearance of depth and surface detail without adding geometry. It works by manipulating texture coordinates in a shader to create the illusion of complex surface features, like bumps, grooves, or cavities, that react to light and viewing angle."
