	title:"Children in Crisis"
	,unit:11
	,en:"Growing up in America is different for most young people today than it was for their parents. Fear of violence and crime seems to be everywhere, from the streets of large cities to the halls of suburban and rural schools. Teenage boys, who once fought over their places in the drug markets, now shoot so readily that the reasons may be only sneakers, leather jackets, or insults. Bystanders are caught in the crossfire of drug wars and people can be shot just because a young person feels like killing someone. Some kids have become so desensitised to shooting that they laugh about it. On the streets in many cities, robbing the others is considered a symbol of honour.<br>\
	There seem to be more senseless crimes done by juveniles that appear to lack a motive. For example, young people tried to set fire to homeless men sleeping in subway stations as many as twenty times in 1992. In these crimes, no one takes anything of value; there is nothing to take. The victims all appeared to be strangers to their torturers. One fire setter explained that he and his friends were playing near a man who was sleeping in the subway and they accidentally spilled some of their beer on him. Then they threw matches at him and when his blanket caught fire, they ran. Two other homeless men, who happened to come along soon after the fire started, threw themselves on the man and put the flames out. They called the police, and ran after the boys. At the police station, the boys were charged with assault and attempted murder. They gave no good reasons for the attempts, although the fun of it was suggested as a motive.<br>\
	Almost everyone agrees that many young criminals are becoming more violent. The number of murders under the age of eighteen has climbed 93 percent since the 1980s. Murder is more common among today's children, many of whom are in trouble because of the violence around them. The Children's Defense Fund, a non-profit organisation, reports that two children under the age of five are murdered in America each day. In the same short period of time, about 7000 children are reported abused or neglected. Many more cases are not reported.<br>\
	Many adults are not, or do not want to be, aware of what is happening to today's children. They move farther from the cities, believing they can escape the problems of children in trouble. But even conservative magazines that usually devote their pages more to business than social problems are printing articles about today's 'children in crisis'. For example, in one issue of Forbes magazine, boys and girls from different cities talk about violence, hopes, cops, racism, drugs, school, and family. Others talk about suicide and abuse.<br>\
	The Committee for Economic Development states publicly that it is concerned about whether or not children of today will have sufficient education, motivations, and undamaged brains to provide the needs of tomorrow's labour force."

	title:"Real-Time Electronic Discussion for Teaching Writing"
	,unit:11
	,en:"The most obvious use of real-time electronic discussion is for the teaching of writing. Students in general, and particularly second language students, often have a great fear of expressing their ideas in writing. To help overcome this fear and give their students as much writing practice as possible, some composition teachers conduct almost all of their courses through electronic discussion. They find that the more students write, the more comfortable they get with it especially because their writing occurs in such a powerful communicative context. Every word they put down is not for the purpose of being corrected by their teacher, but rather for the purpose of sharing ideas with their classmates.<br>\
	Janice Cook teaches several ESL writing courses at Kapiolani Community College in Honolulu. All of Cook's classes are taught 100% online, with students writing back and forth together in pairs, in small groups, and as a class. Students write about the writing process, discuss electronically things they have read, share their own work with the others and compose compositions together. Cook contributes to the process as a guide rather than as an all-knowing expert. She has taught this way for 3 years and says she feared even the thought of going back to non-networked writing instruction.<br>\
	Pratt and Sullivan conducted a semester-long study on the effects of electronic discussion on teaching ESL writing at the University of Puerto Rico. They compared two ESL writing classes taught with the same syllabus but under different conditions. One class met one or two times a week in a computer-networked classroom where virtually all class discussion was carried out electronically. The other class was conducted in a traditional classroom with oral discussion.<br>\
	An analysis of the transcripts of large group discussions, one from each class, showed strong differences in participation patterns. Whereas only 50% of the students spoke up even once during the oral discussion, 100% of the students participated in the electronic discussion. Furthermore, in the oral discussion the teacher took 85% of the conversational turns, whereas in the electronic discussion the teacher took only 35% of the turns.<br>\
	Pratt and Sullivan used pre- and post-writing samples to compare the writing improvement of the two groups. They found that students in the computer-networked class showed significantly greater gains in writing than the students did in the traditional class.<br>\
	Studies of native speaker composition classes have also shown similar advantages for computer-networked writing instruction, particularly for students who come into a course less skilled or confident about their writing. Linguists have found that less confident students not only communicate more during electronic discussions than during face-to-face ones but also make more useful comments in their own writing."

	title:"Help! Volunteers Wanted"
	,en:"Where? When? How Long? <br>\
	The University of Victoria (Uvic) ESL teacher Sherri Williams needs volunteers to help in her Tutorial Room, which is a self-access, drop-in clinic located at the Wallace Lounge (next to Cadboro Commons Cafeteria, above the end of Parking Lot 5). This clinic is offered Tues days, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 11 :00 am to 3:00 pm every week. ESL students from around the world currently taking Uvic's EIP (English Intensive Programme) attend regular classes for 4 hours every morning or afternoon. In addition, if they wish, they can drop in for as long or as short as they want for extra help in the Tutorial. So we need volunteers to help for an hour or more at a time during this time frame.<br>\
	What Do Volunteers Do? <br>\
	The Tutorial handles all sorts of questions and needs. Volunteers in the Tutorial most often have conversations with the students, thereby helping them with grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary and general listening/speaking skills. ESL students are often assigned interviews for homework by their classroom teachers, and go to the Tutorial to interview volunteers for their opinions on such things as marriage, dating, taxes, Canadian attitudes, examples of slang or idiom use, etc. The Wallace Lounge is ideal for conversations, as it is big and has an outside patio next to the grass. We encourage our ESL students to come with food or drinks and relax in this comfortable environment.<br>\
	Volunteers also help run the small lending library by helping students choose abridged books or helping them choose from a variety of magazines, listening or pronunciation tapes. Volunteers sometimes help students make 20-minute appointments at the Pronunciation Clinic, which is a sub-part of the Tutorial. Students can listen to tapes on individual recorders in the Tutorial Clinic, or borrow some of them from the CALL Facility; volunteers help explain how to do this. There is a TV with an 8-headphone listening station in the Tutorial, so a volunteer can work with up to 7 students to help them understand the CBC TV daily news. ESL students also arrive at the Tutorial wanting help with grammar, writing or questionnaires which they've been asked to complete by their classroom teachers. The Tutorial has grammar worksheets, writing information and general resource books which volunteers can use to help students. Volunteers may also work directly with the students' classroom textbooks. There are also vo cabulary games such as Scrabble. Sherri is always in the Tutorial to help if a volunteer has any questions.<br>\
	What's the Commitment and Benefits? <br>\
	Ideally, Sherri likes volunteers to commit themselves to at least an hour a week on a regular basis for the term, which ends December 6. However, ANY time a volunteer can help is always appreciated. So if you have not signed up, please call, whether you are able to commit for part of the term, or just drop in once in a while. Every volunteer who has worked in our clinic has com mented how much fun they have had working there, and how much it has helped them deepen their understanding of intercultural differences, their studies and/or teaching work they may be struggling to master.<br>\
	How Do Volunteers Sign Up? <br>\
	Please leave a message for Sherri at the English Language Centre, 721-8469, or come by and talk to her in the Wallace Lounge any Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday between 11:00 am and 3:00 pm"

	,title:"Modern Examinations "
	,en:"In ancient times the most important examinations were spoken, not written. In the schools of ancient Greece and Rome, testing usually consisted of saying poetry aloud or giving speeches.<br>\
	In the European universities of the Middle Ages, students who were working for advanced degrees had to discuss questions in their field of study with people who had made a special study of the subject. This custom exists today as a part of the process of testing candidates for the doctor's degree.<br>\
	Generally, however, modern examinations are written. The written examination, where all students are tested on the same questions, was probably not known until the nineteenth century. Perhaps it came into existence with the great increase in population and the develop ment of modern industry. A room full of candidates for a state examination, timed exactly by electric clocks and carefully watched over by managers, resembles a group of workers at an automobile factory. Certainly, during examinations teachers and students are expected to act like machines. There is nothing very human about the examination process.<br>\
	Two types of tests are commonly used in modern schools. The first type is sometimes called an 'objective' test. It is intended to deal with facts, not personal opinions. To make up an objective test, the teacher writes a series of questions, each of which has only one correct answer. Along with each question, the teacher writes the correct answer and also three state ments that look like answers to students who have not learned the material properly.<br>\
	In objective tests the student has just one task: he must recognise the correct answer and copy its letter (or number) on his examination paper. Sometimes there is an answer sheet on which the four letters or numbers are printed. Then the student has only to circle the one that goes with the correct answer.<br>\
	For testing a student's memory of facts and details, the objective test has advantages. It can be scored very quickly by the teacher or even by a machine. In a short time, the teacher can find out a great deal about the student's range of knowledge.<br>\
	For testing some kinds of learning, however, such a test is not very satisfactory. A lucky student may guess the correct answer without really knowing the material. Moreover, some of the wrong answers are usually more incorrect than others, yet the scores on the test will not take account of this fact.<br>\
	For a clearer picture of what the student knows, most teachers use another kind of examination in addition to objective tests. They use 'essay' tests, which require students to write long answers to broad and general questions.<br>\
	One advantage of the essay test is that it reduces the element of luck. The student can not get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in essay form.<br>\
	Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. From this standpoint, the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score.<br>\
	Most teachers and students would probably agree that examinations are unsatisfactory. Students dislike taking them; teachers dislike giving them and scoring students' answers. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be obtained."

	,title:"More Cavities Needed"
	,en:"Bluebirds live in cavities, but they can't make their own cavities. Like woodpeckers, bluebirds prefer trees in open areas. The best habitat for bluebirds is an open area with scattered trees such as an old garden. By clearing sections of forest to create more fields, early settlers happened to improve bluebird habitat. Bluebirds feed on insects on the ground, and insects were abundant in the fields.<br>\
In the early 1900s, eastern bluebirds were one of the most common songbirds, but by 1969 fewer than 100 bluebirds nested in Minnesota. Other states also reported severe declines in the populations of all three bluebird species.<br>\
Why did the populations decline? One factor may have been the widespread use of insecticides, but the most important factor was probably the loss of habitat. At first, fences were built with wooden posts, and wooden posts develop cavities. While bluebirds like fence posts with cavities, farmers do not. Cavities make the fence posts weak, and cattle escape through weak fences. After World War II, most farmers replaced wooden posts with new posts made of steel.<br>\
With less suitable habitat, the bluebirds were forced to compete with other birds for the few remaining nesting sites. More aggressive birds such as the tree swallow and the house wren often drive the bluebirds from their nests. Starlings and house sparrows - both introduced to this country from Europe - also compete with the bluebirds for nesting sites.<br>\
All three bluebird populations - eastern, western, and mountain- declined nearly 90 percent between 1935 and 1985. The North American Bluebird Society and others are working to increase the number of bluebirds. The most successful method is to improve the habitat by providing the bluebirds with boxes as living places. Thousands of boxes are placed and being managed by individuals interested in helping the little bird.<br>\
If placed in the right environment, the boxes do attract bluebirds. Bluebirds prefer boxes placed next to open areas. If placed near a brushy area, the boxes are more likely to attract house wrens. Tree swallows would compete for isolated sites in open areas. Competition from tree swallows will decrease if the boxes are placed in pairs, less than three feet apart. Boxes for mountain and western bluebirds must have slightly larger holes than those for eastern bluebirds, but if the holes are too large, starlings will take the boxes.<br>\
Another cavity programme helped the wood duck population. When seeking for houses, the female wood duck looks for a cavity in a tree that is in or near the water. Often she chooses a cavity with a hole too small for a raccoon to enter. Human activities -logging mature trees and hunting - threaten the wood duck population. In 1918, the United States and Canadian governments banned the hunting of this species. Groups of citizens and conservation organisations built living boxes and placed them on poles or in trees that are in or near the water. Today the wood duck population is greater than one million, and hunting is once again permitted."

	,title:"Our Exploding Population: Problems and Solutions"
	,en:"Section I<br>\
Almost everyone thinks about the future. We try to imagine life in thirty, forty, or fifty years. What will life on the earth be like? According to many people, it will not be very pleasant. These people are very worried about the future. One of the main problems which worries them is overpopulation. In 1975 there were about four billion people in the world, and the population was increasing by about 2% every year. At the end of the twentieth century, the population of the world reached six billion people.<br>\
Section II<br>\
Why is this increase in population a problem? First, a large part of the growth is taking place in countries that do not always have enough food for their present population. Without a great deal of money, food, and medical assistance from other nations, these countries will not be able to support their growing population. Many of their people, perhaps millions of them, will die of starvation or disease. But overpopulation is not only a problem for developing countries. It is also a serious problem for the countries of the world which do not usually have food problems. In wealthy, industrial nations, large increases in the population will have negative effects on life. We will have to heat and cool more houses, apartment buildings, schools and hospitals. We will have to transport more people to and from work. For all this, we will have to use more of the world's natural resources. Perhaps the world will not have enough oil, water, coal, and wood for all our needs.<br>\
Section III<br>\
One solution which many people suggest is to limit the number of children who are born. There are now a number of safe, modern methods of birth control. A married couple who use birth control can choose the size of their family. A number of countries with large populations have government programmes for birth control. India, for example, advertises birth control on the radio and television. Teams of workers go out into the countryside and teach the people about the benefits of family planning. In China, couples who only have one child or no child get apartments before couples with three children or more. In many other countries, birth control is a subject that school students study in special classes.<br>\
Section IV<br>\
But how successful are these birth control programmes? Some are very successful. In countries like Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and Great Britain, families are quite small, and the population is increasing very slowly; in some of these countries, it is not growing at all. But these are wealthy, developed countries, which can feed their people without difficulty. In developing countries, many of the birth control programmes are not successful.<br>\
Section V<br>\
There are a number of possible reasons for the failure of birth control programmes in developing countries. One reason is religion. Many people belong to religions which do not accept modern method of birth control. For them, birth control is wrong, and they naturally refuse to listen to family planning workers. Another reason for the failure of birth control programmes is economics. Often a large number of children are necessary for very poor families in developing countries. Children can work and help support the family. Also, without a welfare system, people have to depend on their children for food, clothing, and shelter in their old age. In these countries, people just cannot see any reason for small families.<br>\
Section VI<br>\
For other people, birth control is definitely not the solution the world needs for the problem of overpopulation. In their opinion, government should not decide family size. It is not right. The solution which these people suggest is to increase world food production. They draw our attention to the progress that agricultural scientists are making. With irrigation, for example, we can now produce food in many parts of the world which did not produce anything fifteen or twenty years ago. We can even grow plants in water without soil. Scientists are also doing research into plants which grow quickly and into new farming techniques. The governments of rich countries will have to help the poor countries. Without economic assistance from the wealthy nations, poor countries will not be able to use the new products and farming techniques that scientists are developing.<br>\
Section VII<br>\
Birth control and an increase in food production are two possible solutions to the problem of overpopulation. Perhaps there are other solutions. Almost certainly there is no one easy answer to the problem: we will have to use a number of solutions. Then perhaps we will be able to solve the problem of the population explosion."

	title:"The Importance Of Children's Play"
	,en:"Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom. Imagining fairy-tale turrets and fire-breathing dragons, wicked witches and gallant heroes, she's creating an enchanting world. Although she isn't aware of it, this fantasy is helping her take her first steps towards her capacity for creativity and so it will have important repercussions in her adult life.<br>\
	Minutes later, Alice has abandoned the kingdom in favour of playing schools with her younger brother. When she bosses him around as his 'teacher', she's practising how to regulate her emotions through pretence. Later on, when they tire of this and settle down with a board game, she's learning about the need to follow rules and take turns with a partner.<br>\
	'Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of the human species,' says Dr David Whitebread from the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge, UK. 'It underpins how we develop as intellectual, problem-solving adults and is crucial to our success as a highly adaptable species.'<br>\
	Recognising the importance of play is not new: over two millennia ago, the Greek philosopher Plato extolled its virtues as a means of developing skills for adult life, and ideas about play-based learning have been developing since the 19th century.<br>\
	But we live in changing times, and Whitebread is mindful of a worldwide decline in play, pointing out that over half the people in the world now live in cities. 'The opportunities for free play, which I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming increasingly scarce,' he says. Outdoor play is curtailed by perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as parents' increased wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by the emphasis on 'earlier is better' which is leading to greater competition in academic learning and schools.<br>\
	International bodies like the United Nations and the European Union have begun to develop policies concerned with children's right to play, and to consider implications for leisure facilities and educational programmes. But what they often lack is the evidence to base policies on.<br>\
	Dr Jenny Gibson agrees, pointing out that although some of the steps in the puzzle of how and why play is important have been looked at, there is very little data on the impact it has on the child's later life.<br>\
	Now, thanks to the university's new Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDAL), Whitebread, Baker, Gibson and a team of researchers hope to provide evidence on the role played by play in how a child develops.<br>\
	'A strong possibility is that play supports the early development of children's self-control,' explains Baker. 'This is our ability to develop awareness of our own thinking processes - it influences how effectively we go about undertaking challenging activities.'<br>\
	In a study carried out by Baker with toddlers and young pre-schoolers, she found that children with greater self-control solved problems more quickly when exploring an unfamiliar set-up requiring scientific reasoning. 'This sort of evidence makes us think that giving children the chance to play will make them more successful problem-solvers in the long run.'<br>\
	If playful experiences do facilitate this aspect of development, say the researchers, it could be extremely significant for educational practices, because the ability to self-regulate has been shown to be a key predictor of academic performance.<br>\
	Gibson adds: 'Playful behaviour is also an important indicator of healthy social and emotional development. In my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can give us important clues about their well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.'<br>\
	Whitebread's recent research has involved developing a play-based approach to supporting children's writing. 'Many primary school children find writing difficult, but we showed in a previous study that a playful stimulus was far more effective than an instructional one.' Children wrote longer and better-structured stories when they first played with dolls representing characters in the story. In the latest study, children first created their story with Lego*, with similar results. 'Many teachers commented that they had always previously had children saying they didn't know what to write about. With the Lego building, however, not a single child said this through the whole year of the project.'<br>\
	Whitebread, who directs PEDAL, trained as a primary school teacher in the early 1970s, when, as he describes, 'the teaching of young children was largely a quiet backwater, untroubled by any serious intellectual debate or controversy.' Now, the landscape is very different, with hotly debated topics such as school starting age.<br>\
	'Somehow the importance of play has been lost in recent decades. It's regarded as something trivial, or even as something negative that contrasts with 'work'. Let's not lose sight of its benefits, and the fundamental contributions it makes to human achievements in the arts, sciences and technology. Let's make sure children have a rich diet of play experiences.'"

	title:"The Intersection of Health Sciences and Geography"
	,en:"A <br>\
	While many diseases that affect humans have been eradicated due to improvements in vaccinations and the availability of healthcare, there are still areas around the world where certain health issues are more prevalent. In a world that is far more globalised than ever before, people come into contact with one another through travel and living closer and closer to each other. As a result, super-viruses and other infections resistant to antibiotics are becoming more and more common.<br>\
	B <br>\
	Geography can often play a very large role in the health concerns of certain populations. For instance, depending on where you live, you will not have the same health concerns as someone who lives in a different geographical region. Perhaps one of the most obvious examples of this idea is malaria-prone areas, which are usually tropical regions that foster a warm and damp environment in which the mosquitos that can give people this disease can grew. Malaria is much less of a problem in high-altitude deserts, for instance.<br>\
	C <br>\
	In some countries, geographical factors influence the health and well-being of the population in very obvious ways. In many large cities, the wind is not strong enough to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and pollution that cause asthma, lung problems, eyesight issues and more in the people who live there. Part of the problem is, of course, the massive number of cars being driven, in addition to factories that run on coal power. The rapid industrialisation of some countries in recent years has also led to the cutting down of forests to allow for the expansion of big cities, which makes it even harder to fight the pollution with the fresh air that is produced by plants.<br>\
	D <br>\
	It is in situations like these that the field of health geography comes into its own. It is an increasingly important area of study in a world where diseases like polio are re-emerging, respiratory diseases continue to spread, and malaria-prone areas are still fighting to find a better cure. Health geography is the combination of, on the one hand, knowledge regarding geography and methods used to analyse and interpret geographical information, and on the other, the study of health, diseases and healthcare practices around the world. The aim of this hybrid science is to create solutions for common geography-based health problems. While people will always be prone to illness, the study of how geography affects our health could lead to the eradication of certain illnesses, and the prevention of others in the future. By understanding why and how we get sick, we can change the way we treat illness and disease specific to certain geographical locations.<br>\

	The geography of disease and ill health analyses the frequency with which certain diseases appear in different parts of the world, and overlays the data with the geography of the region, to see if there could be a correlation between the two. Health geographers also study factors that could make certain individuals or a population more likely to be taken ill with a specific health concern or disease, as compared with the population of another area. Health geographers in this field are usually trained as healthcare workers, and have an understanding of basic epidemiology as it relates to the spread of diseases among the population.<br>\
	F <br>\
	Researchers study the interactions between humans and their environment that could lead to illness (such as asthma in places with high levels of pollution) and work to create a clear way of categorising illnesses, diseases and epidemics into local and global scales. Health geographers can map the spread of illnesses and attempt to identify the reasons behind an increase or decrease in illnesses, as they work to find a way to halt the further spread or re-emergence of diseases in vulnerable populations.<br>\
	G <br>\
	The second subcategory of health geography is the geography of healthcare provision. This group studies the availability (of lack thereof) of healthcare resources to individuals and populations around the world. In both developed and developing nations there is often a very large discrepancy between the options available to people in different social classes, income brackets, and levels of education. Individuals working in the area of the geography of healthcare provision attempt to assess the levels of healthcare in the area (for instance, it may be very difficult for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain between their village and the nearest hospital). These researchers are on the frontline of making recommendations regarding policy to international organisations, local government bodies and others.<br>\
	H <br>\
	The field of health geography is often overlooked, but it constitutes a huge area of need in the fields of geography and healthcare. If we can understand how geography affects our health no matter where in the world we are located, we can better treat disease, prevent illness, and keep people safe and well."
