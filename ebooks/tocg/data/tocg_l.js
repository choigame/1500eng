,en:"1) We had a good response to our survey and we found that, while 80% of our students drink coffee, only 15% drink tea, with the rest preferring water.<br>\
2) Over 800000 people in the US are estimated to have tried skiing. This may seem a large number but it represents just over 0,26% of the total population of 300 million. So, per capita, it is surprisingly small.<br>\
3) It's estimated that India is home to between 38000 and<br>\
53000 wild elephants, while Africa has between 470000 and 690000. Exact figures are difficult to determine. <br>\
4) An elephant can weigh between 2,5 and 5 tonnes. This is comparable to the tongue of the blue whale, which alone can weigh 2,7 tonnes. In fact, a blue whale can weigh 15 times more than an elephant, and can grow to about 10 times the size of a standard bus."

B: Oh, good morning, I'm thinking of going on a skiing trip. Can you tell me about any good offers on at the moment?<br>\

A: Welcome to the York Hotel, are you checking in?<br>\
B: Yes, that's right. My name's Bob Clarke. I've got a booking. <br>\
A: Great. I'll just get a few personal details from you.<br>\
3)<br>\
A: Well, I don't think I have any more questions. Is there anything you'd like to ask me about the job?<br>\
B: Yes, I was wondering if it involves a lot of travel, and what the working hours are."

A: This one's a good deal. It costs £150 and airfares are included in that price. Once you land, you still need to get to the ski slopes. It's a two-hour journey.<br>\
B: Yes, I know, I have a friend there who's going to meet me and we'll travel together.<br>\
A: Oh, that's fine, I usually organise a coach ticket for my customers, because a taxi is far too expensive. But a lift from a local is even better. What about skiing equipment? <br>\
B: I've already got all of that, but I would like to arrange insurance if that's possible.<br>\
A: Yes, of course. And it's a very good idea for a holiday like that.<br>\
2)<br>\
A: And it says here you'll be staying with us for two nights, is that right?<br>\
B: Actually, my plans have changed since I made the booking and I was hoping I'd be able to stay for one extra night, if it's possible.<br>\
A: I'll just have a look and try to make sure you don't have to change rooms on the third night. Yes, that's fine, and in fact you'll get a 25% discount as well.<br>\
B: Oh, great. Do you have a gym or a sports centre in the<br>\
hotel? And I need access to your business centre as well. <br>\
A: Yes, we have all of those. Now, your room is up on the tenth floor, and the elevators are right behind you. You'll actually be on the same floor as the business centre, and it's clearly signposted. The gym is down on this level and so is the restaurant. You need to go there in the morning for breakfast.<br>\

A: Now, according to your CV, you've lived and worked in a few different countries, haven't you?<br>\
B: That's right. I was born here in England and my family emigrated to Australia when I was very young.<br>\
A: But your longest employment so far was in America, if I'm not mistaken?<br>\
B: That's right. I moved there once I'd graduated and worked for five years before coming back to England in January. <br>\
A: Right. And you've worked briefly in accounts but in sales, mostly... Is that the area you are still interested in working in? We have a very strong sales department. <br>\
B: Actually, I'm hoping to move into the area of marketing. I've always been interested in it, and it was my major at university.<br>\
A: I see. Well, with your references I'm sure we can discuss it."

A: Well, we need to sort out food, for a start.<br>\
B: Why don't we just order some pizzas?<br>\
A: But we always do that. Let's do something a bit different. Besides, it's pretty expensive.<br>\
B: What about a barbecue then, or we could just do hot dogs. <br>\
A: Hmm, too much preparation involved. There are a lot coming, you know.<br>\
B: Sandwiches then? That's easy enough.<br>\
A: Sandwiches? That's a good idea. Hmm, hang on, that would be even more preparation than the barbecue! Better go back to the original idea, I suppose.<br>\
B: Pizzas it is, then!<br>\
A: Now, we also need to think about music, and invitations. <br>\
B: Well, we don't need to buy invitations, I think we should just do them on the computer and keep costs down.<br>\
A: Good idea. And what about music?<br>\
B: We can just use the same stuff we had last time. It's fine. <br>\
A: OK, well, if we don't let people know soon there won't be anyone there. So let's make that our priority. Have you got your laptop?<br>\
B: Yeah, told you there wasn't much to do.<br>\
Section 3<br>\
A: Hi Julie, have you got time to plan our project?<br>\
B: Sure, I've got a few minutes. We need to choose a topic based on the theme of pollution, don't we?<br>\
A: That's right. Have you got any preferences?<br>\
B: Well, I did a huge assignment on water pollution last year so we could just do that?<br>\
A: Actually, the tutor did make a point of saying not to use last year's materials. So we'd better not.<br>\
B: It's probably a bit out of date now anyway. Also, it focused specifically on industry and I think we're supposed to take a broad view.<br>\
A: That's right. We could look at something totally different, like the effects of fumes on air quality.<br>\
B: Hmm, good idea. And we could make sure we include all of the sources, like traffic and factories.<br>\
A: So, what else do we need to do? Shall we go to the library and look for resources?<br>\
B: Actually, I think we'd be better off looking online. The good resources in the library are often all out at this time of the year. Anyway, before we notify the tutor which topic we've chosen, I think we need to ask the others what they're doing.<br>\
A: You're right. We need to make sure we're not all doing the same thing. Let's ask them this afternoon in the tutorial.<br>\
B: Great idea."

A: Chào Sam, chúng ta nên bắt đầu lên kế hoạch cho bữa tiệc thôi, còn chưa đầy hai tuần nữa, phải không?<br>\
B: Ừ, tôi đoán là vậy. Không có nhiều việc phải làm, phải không? <br>\
A: Ờ, trước tiên chúng ta cần sắp xếp đồ ăn.<br>\
B: Sao chúng ta không gọi pizza nhỉ?<br>\
A: Nhưng chúng ta luôn làm thế. Hãy làm điều gì đó khác biệt một chút. Hơn nữa, nó khá tốn kém.<br>\
B: Vậy thì tiệc nướng thì sao, hoặc chúng ta có thể chỉ làm xúc xích. <br>\
A: Ừm, quá nhiều thứ phải chuẩn bị. Có rất nhiều thứ sắp tới, bạn biết đấy.<br>\
B: Vậy thì bánh sandwich? Thế thì dễ thôi.<br>\
A: Bánh sandwich? Ý tưởng hay đấy. Ừm, đợi đã, như vậy còn phải chuẩn bị nhiều thứ hơn cả tiệc nướng! Tốt hơn là quay lại ý tưởng ban đầu, tôi cho là vậy.<br>\
B: Vậy thì là pizza!<br>\
A: Bây giờ, chúng ta cũng cần nghĩ đến âm nhạc và lời mời. <br>\
B: Vâng, chúng ta không cần mua lời mời, tôi nghĩ chúng ta chỉ nên làm trên máy tính và tiết kiệm chi phí.<br>\
A: Ý tưởng hay. Còn âm nhạc thì sao?<br>\
B: Chúng ta có thể sử dụng những thứ chúng ta đã có lần trước. Không sao cả. <br>\
A: Được thôi, nếu chúng ta không sớm cho mọi người biết thì sẽ chẳng có ai ở đó. Vậy thì hãy ưu tiên điều đó. Bạn đã có máy tính xách tay chưa?<br>\
B: Vâng, tôi đã nói với bạn là không có nhiều việc để làm mà.<br>\
Phần 3<br>\
A: Chào Julie, bạn có thời gian để lên kế hoạch cho dự án của chúng ta không?<br>\
B: Chắc chắn rồi, tôi có vài phút. Chúng ta cần chọn một chủ đề dựa trên chủ đề ô nhiễm, phải không?<br>\
A: Đúng rồi. Bạn có sở thích nào không?<br>\
B: À, năm ngoái mình đã làm một bài tập lớn về ô nhiễm nước nên chúng ta có thể làm vậy thôi?<br>\
A: Thực ra, giáo viên hướng dẫn đã nói rõ là không nên sử dụng tài liệu của năm ngoái. Vậy nên tốt hơn là chúng ta không nên.<br>\
B: Dù sao thì bây giờ có lẽ nó hơi lỗi thời rồi. Ngoài ra, nó tập trung cụ thể vào ngành công nghiệp và tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên có cái nhìn tổng quát.<br>\
A: Đúng rồi. Chúng ta có thể xem xét một thứ hoàn toàn khác, như tác động của khói bụi lên chất lượng không khí.<br>\
B: Ồ, ý tưởng hay đấy. Và chúng ta có thể đảm bảo rằng mình bao gồm tất cả các nguồn, như giao thông và nhà máy.<br>\
A: Vậy, chúng ta cần làm gì nữa? Chúng ta sẽ đến thư viện và tìm tài liệu chứ?<br>\
B: Thực ra, tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên tìm kiếm trực tuyến. Các nguồn tài liệu hay trong thư viện thường hết vào thời điểm này trong năm. Dù sao thì, trước khi thông báo cho giáo viên về chủ đề chúng ta đã chọn, tôi nghĩ chúng ta cần hỏi những người khác xem họ đang làm gì.<br>\
A: Bạn nói đúng. Chúng ta cần đảm bảo rằng không phải tất cả chúng ta đều làm cùng một việc. Hãy hỏi họ vào chiều nay trong buổi hướng dẫn.<br>\
B: Ý tưởng tuyệt vời."

A: But that's so broad a topic. We should try to narrow it down. What about recycling?<br>\
B: That's a good idea, there's a lot of information and I think the other groups are concentrating on pollution. So this would be nice and different.<br>\

We encountered quite a few problems during our research. Firstly, the weather was horrendous and made our work conditions very difficult indeed. Luckily, we had the right equipment to deal with that, and could carry on regardless. Unfortunately though, in spite of having so many volunteers, we did run out of funds halfway through the project. So, we were forced to postpone the second half of our trip."

I just wanted to tell you about some of the recent changes we've made to the garden at the back of the complex, which we all have access to. As you know, there are some attractive and well-established plants in there and we didn't want to take any of these out. But many of these are struggling in the harsh sun, which falls directly on that area. To solve this we're going to plant trees along the western edge of the garden, just near the pond. This should also become a very pleasant place to sit and watch the ducks in the water.<br>\
3<br>\
A: It's nearly there. I think we've found plenty of information. <br>\
B: Yes, lots, in fact do you think we need to reduce any of it? <br>\
A: Not at all, in fact I was thinking we could try and include some of those nice graphics you found.<br>\
B: OK, it would certainly make it look a bit more interesting.<br>\

Studying ice cores in the South Pole can tell us a lot about the past climate, which, in turn, can help us understand how today's climate is changing. My particular area of study is snow. While we scientists understand the process of how snow is created, very little is known about how snow interacts with the atmosphere and influences our weather patterns. One of the things we're trying to do is to link what we already know about meteorology and clouds and determine the impact that snow has on that."

	,en:"In today's show I'm going to be looking at what's new in technology this week. And I'd like to start by looking at the much-awaited OP56 mobile phone from technology giants Optiware. It has some amazing features. The first thing you notice is how much slimmer and lighter it is compared to the heavier older models. It's incredible considering that they have actually increased the screen size on this one, though it still fits neatly into your pocket. They've also improved the camera and you'll find you can take much better quality photos on this model. This has an impact on the battery though, as it takes a lot of power and I found it didn't run for very long before needing to be recharged. Despite all its amazing features, it's extremely easy to use, but I do have to say that it is overpriced, and will be beyond the budget of most people shopping for a new phone."

Welcome to the resort! I'll just tell you about some of our facilities. We've got a lovely little pond, where guests are welcome to sit and have a picnic. You'll see it as you come in the entrance. In the middle of the resort, you'll see a circular courtyard, it has some lovely cool places to sit as well. You can see our famous fig tree from there, it's enormous! To the right of the courtyard, you'll find a small shop where you can pick up things like postcards and stamps. It's just behind the tree.<br>\

B: Well, that would save costs.<br>\
A: Exactly, but I realised that it would create costs in other<br>\
areas as it would mean some important buildings being knocked down. So I think it would be better if it's at the eastern end of the motorway.<br>\
B: That's a good idea, it would be a lot more useful than if it was at the western end.<br>\

The Traviston Frog is different to many other species of frog. It is very small and so, unlike other species, it is unable to live in the area of a pond, though it does need to live in fairly close proximity to water so that it can feed. Rather than choosing the safety of a tree, which would be too tall and may actually increase the threat from predators, it elects to live in a tiny burrow surrounded by bushes."

So, I just wanted to give you a briefing about what you can find where. The information booth is to the right of the entrance and I've given you all a plan to mark important places on. One of the most common enquiries is where can I pay for my parking? People are amazed when we tell them that it's free now. We used to charge for it and there was a ticket booth to the left of the entrance, but now that it's been turned into a small stage, we hold cookery demonstrations there. Local chefs come in and show people how to prepare dishes. It's really popular and you get a nice view of the fountain there. We have over 50 stalls at the markets, selling everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to locally made crafts. Which unfortunately means people won't find things like books or anything second-hand. We have a famous baker at the market and many people get here really early just to buy his produce. His stall is located at the back of the markets next to the barbecue. We sell burgers and sausages there but a lot of people like to bring their own lunch to eat and they're welcome to go to the special area near the tree in the middle of the markets where they can do just that. It's handy for the toilets too. The markets are located next to a circus school that holds classes for children at the weekend, so we often get a lot of family groups in. There's a playground on the right-hand side that's popular with them, and just in front of that is where the farmers bring along chickens, rabbits and lambs for the children to pet. That's always a very popular feature so you'll definitely be asked about that. Just let people know there is a small fee if the children want to feed them. Well, that's everything for now..."
